# Running libpostal with Docker

**Not finished or maintained (Dec 2020).** Figured out how to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to use libpostal, was easier than dealing with Docker (TBH).

[Libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal) is a library for parsing and normalizing address strings. This project is for creating a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/) that can run libpostal on an address file.
